# DeepFace®
DeepFace® is a Neural network system designed to swap multiple faces in videos with impressive accuracy.

Take a video and replace the face in it with a face of your choice.
You only need one image of the desired face. No dataset, no training.

## Installation

Clone Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/skytells-research/deepface
```


Install dependencies
We highly recommend to work with a venv or conda to avoid issues.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You should be able to run deepface using python run.py command. 

Keep in mind that while running the program for first time, it will download some models which can take time depending on your network connection.
